micro.js
========
micro.js is a simple 
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) library for 
creating small [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5) rich internet 
applications.  It is intended for use by beginner programmers that have 
no prior knowledge of computer programming.  The environment it provides 
is very much inspired by the minimal programming environments of the 
[microcomputers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) from the 
1980s, drawing ideas from both the 
[BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_BASIC) and 
[LOGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29) 
graphics APIs.
