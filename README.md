gamework.js
===========

Intorduction
------------
gamework.js is a simple 
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) framework for 
creating small [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html5) computer
games.  It is intended for use by beginner programmers that have 
no prior knowledge of computer programming.  The environment it provides 
is very much inspired by the minimal programming environments of the 
[microcomputers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) from the 
1980s, drawing ideas from both the 
[BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_BASIC) and 
[LOGO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29) 
graphics APIs.


Goals
-----
 *  A simple environment that allows beginner programmers to start 
    writing visually intersting applications quickly.
 

Guidelines
----------
 *  Only require the user to understand values (numbers, stings, 
    arrays, objects and functions), variables, control stuctures, 
    function calls and declarations.
 *  Focus on a more functional programming style al-la LISPs and LOGOs.
 *  This may be contiversial, but favor a flat global namespace for the
    functions of the library.
 *  It sould be possible to do something visual with only one line of 
    code.
 *  Use best practice when it dosn't get in the way of the previous 
    guide lines.
