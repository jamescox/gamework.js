      - name: random
        type:
          - '() -> number'
          - '(upper : number) -> number'

        summary: Returns a random number.
        
        detail: The random number returned will lie between the `lower`
                and `upper` parameters.
        
        parameters:
          - name:   lower
            detail: the lower limit of the number to generate (default is 0).
          - name:   upper
            detail: the upper limit of the number to generate (default is 1).
            
        returns: The randomly generated number.
